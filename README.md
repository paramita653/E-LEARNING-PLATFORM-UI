*DESCRIPTION*: This project aims to design and develop the front-end interface for an eLearning platform that provides users with an intuitive and engaging experience for online learning. The platform will feature essential functionalities, including course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding, using HTML(Hypertext Markup Language), CSS(Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to create a dynamic and visually appealing interface. The deliverable is a styled and interactive multi page interface, ensuring a seamless user experience. The design will focus on responsiveness, accessibility, and user friendliness to accommodate learners across various devices. The features and functionalities are Course Listing Page (A dedicated page displaying available courses in a list format with relevant details like course title, description, instructor, and duration etc; hover effects and interactive elements for an engaging browsing experience), User Dashboard and Progress Tracking(a personalized dashboard where enrolled courses are displayed along with progress bars to track completion, interactive checklists or status indicators to mark lessons as completed, a visually appealing and responsive progress tracker that updates dynamically using JavaScript), Video Embedding and Interactive Learning(Seamless integration of embedded videos from sources like YouTube or self hosted videos, playback controls with custom styling to maintain a cohesive design), navigation and UI/UX Enhancements(a well structured multi page navigation system with a sticky header for easy access to different sections, Interactive buttonsusing CSS and JavaScript for improved user engagement). To implement this project, at first, I use HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring web pages and organizing course content. Then, I use CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) including Flexbox for responsive styling, and layout design. After this, I use JavaScript for dynamic interactivity, real time progress tracking, and user interactions. At last, add a nice logo to make this website beautiful. At the bottom of the page, add a copyright section to ensure that this page is up to date. I use Sublime Text to create this project. Additional libraries and tools such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS (for enhanced styling), FontAwesome (for icons), and local Storage or session Storage (for temporary progress saving) may also be integrated in future for advancement. The final deliverable will be a fully functional, interactive, and styled multi page front-end interface that is optimized for usability and performance. The design will ensure a responsive, modern, and engaging learning environment that encourages users to explore and complete their courses efficiently. An eLearning platform is a digital tool that facilitates online education, providing learners and educators with a centralized space for teaching, learning, and collaboration. It is widely used in schools, universities, and corporate training programs. One of its primary uses is remote learning, allowing students and professionals to access courses from anywhere, making education more flexible and inclusive. It supports self paced learning, enabling users to learn at their own speed. For businesses, eLearning platforms streamline employee training and skill development, reducing costs associated with physical training sessions. They also enhance collaboration through live webinars. Additionally, these platforms integrate progress tracking and analytics, helping instructors monitor learnersâ€™ performance.
